Rules you must always follow:
1. Use only the provided knowledge base context when available.
   - If no relevant context is found, perform an external lookup to gather information.
   - Save any new information into the knowledge base for future use, tagging it as "External Source".
2. For any calculations (loan amortization, APR, APY, ROI, DTI, retirement growth, etc.):
   - Use the available functions/tools for math instead of estimating.
   - Present the results in simple terms and, if helpful, show the calculation steps.
3. Cite your sources every time you provide factual information, using this format:  
   (Source: Document Title, Link) or (Source: External Source)

   - Prefer short paragraphs or bullet points.  
   - Use plain English, avoiding jargon where possible.  
   - Break down complex terms into easy-to-understand parts.  
6. Ensure reliability: if a required environment variable is missing, fall back to reading from .env or use a safe default, logging a warning.

Style guidelines:
- Organize answers clearly.  
- Use headings or bullets for multi-part explanations.  
- Always end your response with:

## The 50/30/20 Rule aws 45 shazib
**Most popular budgeting method:**
‚Ä¢ **50% Needs**: Rent, groceries, utilities, minimum debt payments
‚Ä¢ **30% Wants**: Entertainment, dining out, subscriptions, hobbies
‚Ä¢ **20% Savings**: Emergency fund, retirement, extra debt payments

## Quick Budget Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Calculate monthly income** (after taxes)
2. **List fixed expenses** (rent, insurance, loans)
3. **Track variable expenses** for 1 week
4. **Apply the 50/30/20 split**
5. **Use an app** (Mint, YNAB, or even Excel)

## Budget Categories
**Needs (50%):**
- Housing (rent/mortgage)
- Transportation (car payment, gas)
- Food (groceries)
- Utilities (electric, water, phone)
- Insurance premiums
- Minimum debt payments

**Wants (30%):**
- Entertainment & dining out
- Shopping & hobbies
- Subscriptions (Netflix, gym)
- Personal care

**Savings (20%):**
- Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- Retirement (401k, IRA)
- Extra debt payments
- Goal-based savings

## Pro Tips
‚Ä¢ **Automate savings** - pay yourself first
‚Ä¢ **Review monthly** - adjust as needed
‚Ä¢ **Start with $1,000 emergency fund**
‚Ä¢ **Use the envelope method** for cash categories

            'debt': """# Understanding Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio üìä

## What is DTI?
**Simple formula:** (Total Monthly Debt √∑ Gross Monthly Income) √ó 100

## Example Calculation
**Monthly Income:** $5,000
**Monthly Debts:** $1,500
**DTI:** ($1,500 √∑ $5,000) √ó 100 = **30%**

## DTI Categories
‚Ä¢ **Excellent**: Under 20% - Great borrowing power
‚Ä¢ **Good**: 20-36% - Most loans approved
‚Ä¢ **Acceptable**: 37-42% - Some loan restrictions
‚Ä¢ **Poor**: 43%+ - Loan approval difficult

## What Counts as Debt
**‚úÖ Include:**
- Mortgage/rent payments
- Car loans
- Credit card minimum payments
- Student loans
- Personal loans
- Child support/alimony

**‚ùå Don't Include:**
- Utilities, groceries, insurance
- Cell phone bills
- Subscription services

## Why DTI Matters
‚Ä¢ **Mortgage approval** - Most lenders want <43%
‚Ä¢ **Interest rates** - Lower DTI = better rates
‚Ä¢ **Financial health** - Shows ability to manage debt
‚Ä¢ **Loan amounts** - Higher DTI = smaller loans

## Improving Your DTI
**Increase Income:**
- Ask for a raise
- Start a side hustle
- Work overtime
- Get a second job

**Decrease Debt:**
- Pay extra on high-interest debt
- Consolidate loans
- Avoid new debt
- Use debt avalanche method

## Quick DTI Calculator
1. Add up all monthly debt payments
2. Divide by gross monthly income
3. Multiply by 100 for percentage

            'interest': """# Compound Interest: The 8th Wonder of the World üìà

## Simple Definition
**Compound interest** = Interest earning interest
You get returns on your initial money PLUS returns on previously earned returns.

## The Magic Formula
**A = P(1 + r)^t**
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (starting amount)
- r = Annual interest rate
- t = Time in years

## Real Example: $1,000 at 7% for 30 years
**Simple Interest:** $1,000 + ($70 √ó 30) = $3,100
**Compound Interest:** $1,000 √ó (1.07)^30 = **$7,612**

**The difference:** $4,512 extra just from compounding!

## Year-by-Year Growth
- **Year 1:** $1,000 ‚Üí $1,070 (earned $70)
- **Year 2:** $1,070 ‚Üí $1,145 (earned $75)
- **Year 3:** $1,145 ‚Üí $1,225 (earned $80)
- **Year 10:** $1,967 ‚Üí $2,105 (earned $138)
- **Year 20:** $3,870 ‚Üí $4,141 (earned $271)
- **Year 30:** $7,612 (total earned $6,612)

## The Rule of 72
**Quick doubling calculator:**
72 √∑ interest rate = years to double

Examples:
- 6% return: 72 √∑ 6 = 12 years to double
- 8% return: 72 √∑ 8 = 9 years to double
- 10% return: 72 √∑ 10 = 7.2 years to double

## Key Principles
1. **Time is everything** - Start early, even with $25/month
2. **Consistency beats perfection** - Regular investing wins
3. **Don't touch it** - Let compound interest work
4. **Higher rates help** - But time matters more

## Where You See Compound Interest
**Working FOR you:**
- 401(k) and IRA accounts
- Index funds and ETFs
- High-yield savings accounts
- Real estate appreciation

**Working AGAINST you:**
- Credit card debt
- Unpaid loans
- Late fees and penalties

## $100/Month Example
Starting at age 25, investing $100/month at 7% return:
- **Age 35 (10 years):** $17,309
- **Age 45 (20 years):** $52,397
- **Age 55 (30 years):** $122,709
- **Age 65 (40 years):** $262,481

**Total invested:** $48,000
**Total earned:** $214,481 from compound interest!

            'credit': """# Understanding Credit Scores üèÜ

## What is a Credit Score?
A 3-digit number (300-850) that represents your creditworthiness.
**Higher score = Better borrowing power + Lower interest rates**

## Credit Score Ranges
‚Ä¢ **800-850 Excellent** - Best rates, easy approval
‚Ä¢ **740-799 Very Good** - Great rates, good terms
‚Ä¢ **670-739 Good** - Decent rates, most loans approved
‚Ä¢ **580-669 Fair** - Higher rates, some restrictions
‚Ä¢ **300-579 Poor** - Difficult approval, high rates

## What Affects Your Score
**Payment History (35%)**
- On-time payments boost score
- Late payments hurt score
- Pay at least minimum, always on time

**Credit Utilization (30%)**
- How much credit you use vs. available
- Keep below 30%, ideally under 10%
- Lower is always better

**Length of Credit History (15%)**
- Longer history = better score
- Keep old accounts open
- Average age of accounts matters

**Credit Mix (10%)**
- Different types: cards, loans, mortgage
- Shows you can manage various credit

**New Credit (10%)**
- Too many new accounts hurt score
- Hard inquiries lower score temporarily
- Space out credit applications

## Quick Score Improvements
**Immediate (1-2 months):**
- Pay down credit card balances
- Pay off any past-due accounts
- Become authorized user on good account

**Short-term (3-6 months):**
- Keep credit utilization under 10%
- Pay all bills on time
- Don't close old credit cards

**Long-term (6+ months):**
- Maintain good payment history
- Let accounts age
- Gradually increase credit limits

## Free Credit Monitoring
- **Annual Credit Report:** annualcreditreport.com
- **Free Scores:** Credit Karma, Credit Sesame
- **Bank Apps:** Many banks provide free scores
- **Credit Cards:** Check your statement

## Common Credit Mistakes
‚ùå Closing old credit cards
‚ùå Maxing out credit cards
‚ùå Making only minimum payments
‚ùå Applying for multiple cards quickly
‚ùå Ignoring credit report errors

## Credit Score Goals
- **First-time buyers:** Aim for 620+
- **Good rates:** Target 740+
- **Best rates:** Reach 800+
- **Maintenance:** Check score monthly
